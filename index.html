        <!-- Nutrition and Diet Section -->
        <article>
            <h3>Nutrition and Diet</h3>
            <p>A balanced diet is fundamental to sustaining a healthy lifestyle. It's not just about eating less or more; it's about eating the right things in the right amounts.</p>
            
            <h4>Balanced Diet Fundamentals</h4>
            <p>A balanced diet includes a variety of foods in the right proportions, providing essential nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Prioritize whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.</p>
            
            <h4>Importance of Fruits and Vegetables</h4>
            <p>Fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber. They help reduce the risk of chronic diseases, including heart disease, stroke, and some cancers. Aim for at least five servings per day, including a variety of colors for maximum nutrient intake.</p>
            
            <h4>Whole Grains and Lean Proteins</h4>
            <p>Whole grains such as oats, brown rice, and quinoa are rich in fiber, which aids in digestion and helps control blood sugar levels. Lean proteins like chicken, fish, beans, and tofu provide the necessary building blocks for muscle maintenance and repair.</p>

            <h4>Hydration and Its Role in Health</h4>
            <p>Proper hydration is crucial for overall health. Water is involved in every cellular process in the body, from digestion to temperature regulation. Seniors should aim for 8-10 cups of water per day, depending on individual needs.</p>

            <h4>Superfoods for Seniors</h4>
            <p>Superfoods like blueberries, spinach, walnuts, and salmon are nutrient-dense and provide numerous health benefits. Incorporating these foods into your diet can help protect against inflammation, oxidative stress, and other age-related conditions.</p>

            <h4>Common Dietary Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</h4>
            <p>Common mistakes include skipping meals, consuming too much sugar, or not getting enough protein. Avoid these pitfalls by planning balanced meals and paying attention to portion sizes.</p>

        <!-- Physical Activity Section -->
        <article>
            <h3>Physical Activity</h3>
            <p>Regular physical activity is essential for maintaining muscle strength, flexibility, and mental well-being. It's important to stay active to reduce the risk of chronic diseases and improve mobility and independence.</p>

            <h4>Benefits of Regular Exercise for Seniors</h4>
            <p>Exercise helps control weight, strengthens muscles, and improves balance and flexibility. It also boosts mood and energy levels, which is particularly important for mental health in seniors.</p>

            <h4>Types of Exercises: Cardio, Strength Training, Flexibility, and Balance</h4>
            <p>Engage in a mix of cardio (walking, swimming), strength training (light weights, resistance bands), flexibility (yoga, stretching), and balance exercises (Tai Chi, standing on one leg).</p>

            <h4>Safe Exercise Tips</h4>
            <p>Consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new exercise routine. Always warm up before exercising and cool down afterward to prevent injury. Listen to your body and avoid overexertion.</p>

            <h4>Creating a Weekly Exercise Routine</h4>
            <p>Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week, combined with strength training exercises twice a week.</p>

            <h4>Exercises to Do at Home</h4>
            <p>Simple exercises like squats, chair stands, and wall push-ups can be done at home with minimal equipment. These exercises can help maintain strength and mobility without the need for a gym.</p>

        <!-- Mental Health and Wellness Section -->
        <article>
            <h3>Mental Health and Wellness</h3>
            <p>Mental health is just as important as physical health. Managing stress, getting enough sleep, and staying socially active are crucial components of a healthy lifestyle.</p>

            <h4>The Connection Between Physical and Mental Health</h4>
            <p>Physical activity has been shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural mood lifters, and helps manage stress levels.</p>

            <h4>Stress Management Techniques</h4>
            <p>Techniques like deep breathing, meditation, and yoga can help manage stress and improve overall well-being. Engaging in hobbies or spending time in nature can also reduce stress levels.</p>

            <h4>Importance of Sleep and Rest</h4>
            <p>Adequate sleep is essential for cognitive function and overall health. Seniors should aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night. Establish a regular sleep routine and create a restful environment to promote better sleep.</p>

            <h4>Mindfulness and Meditation Practices</h4>
            <p>Mindfulness meditation helps focus attention and improve emotional regulation. It can reduce symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression, improving overall mental health.</p>

            <h4>Social Connections and Community Involvement</h4>
            <p>Maintaining social connections is vital for emotional health. Engaging in community activities, joining clubs, or volunteering can help foster a sense of belonging and reduce feelings of isolation.</p>

            <h4>Importance of Regular Check-ups</h4>
            <p>Routine check-ups can help monitor existing conditions, prevent new health issues, and keep vaccinations up to date. Seniors should have a comprehensive health check-up at least once a year.</p>

            <h4>Essential Screenings for Seniors</h4>
            <p>Screenings such as blood pressure checks, cholesterol levels, bone density tests, and cancer screenings are vital for early detection and treatment of potential health problems.</p>
